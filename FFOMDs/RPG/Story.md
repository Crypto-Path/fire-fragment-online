## History:
In the beginning, humans lived in a world devoid of any moral or ethical boundaries. They were driven by their primal instincts, which led them to commit heinous acts against one another and the environment they inhabited. The only thing that mattered to them was their own personal gain, and they would stop at nothing to achieve it.

As their greed and lust for power grew, they began to experiment with forbidden knowledge and practices. They delved into the depths of science and technology, pushing the boundaries of what was thought to be possible. In their pursuit of knowledge, they unknowingly unleashed a dark force that would ultimately lead to their downfall.

They called this dark force "The Abyss," a source of power beyond anything they had ever known. Those who dared to harness its power were consumed by its darkness and transformed into dark entities, which thie humans decided to call them, "Demons". They became powerful, cunning, and cruel, and they used their newfound abilities to prey upon the weaker humans.

Over time, the demons grew in number and power, and they eventually conquered the world. They built their cities upon the ruins of the old world, reveling in the destruction they had wrought. The humans who survived were forced to flee underground, where they built a new civilization based on science and technology. They called their new capital [Reindex](../OpenWorld/Reindex.md), a beacon of hope in a world consumed by darkness.

For years, the humans of Eden worked tirelessly to develop new technologies that would help them reclaim their world from the demons. They built massive machines capable of drilling through the earth and excavating new resources. They developed advanced weapons capable of taking down demons.

The fate of the world hung in the balance as the humans of [Reindex](../OpenWorld/Reindex.md) struggled to find a way to defeat the demons once and for all. They knew that their survival depended on it, and they were willing to do whatever it took to emerge victorious. The war between humans and demons raged on, with no end in sight.
