# Synthetic Blades

## Background
Originally created as a failed prototype to cure cancer by using a bar of radiation, some mistake magnified it's radiation so much it turned into a solid physical object. People who used the prototype would often find there body start to fail and their organs begin to rot. Precautions where built in to restrict the radiation and limit it's distance to that of a length of a blade, it was then considered and used as a weapon.
