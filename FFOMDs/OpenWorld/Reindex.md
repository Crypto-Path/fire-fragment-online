# Reindex
Short for "index rei". Index, the position in a list and, in japanese, "rei" means zero. So Reindex is the starting spot for everyone, the "World spawn", or the first area you're located in out of many.

Reindex includes many things a beginner might require, aswell as being the main area where everything is located with the exception of very rare or specific things (Ie. [items](), [weapons](), [materials](), and [events]()...). It's open to anyone: noob, versed, fluent, or other, players. It includes [gun shops](), [armour shops](), [event sign-ups]()
